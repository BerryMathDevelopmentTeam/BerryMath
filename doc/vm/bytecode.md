| 0b | shl  | /               | The two elements on the top of the stack, the second element as the base, the top as the number of times to shift left, find the results, and delete the two elements, and finally push the value back to the top of the stack. | shl |
| 0c | shr  | /               | The two elements on the top of the stack, the second element as the base, the top as the number of times to shift right, find the results, and delete the two elements, and finally push the value back to the top of the stack. | shr |
| 0d | eq   | /               | Compare the two elements on the top of the stack to be equal, equal to 1, otherwise 0, and delete the two elements. Finally, push the result back to the top of the stack. | eq |
| 0e | neq  | /               | Compare the two elements on the top of the stack to be not equal, equal to 1, otherwise 0, and delete the two elements. Finally, push the result back to the top of the stack. | neq |
| 0f | lt   | /               | Whether the second element is larger than the top of the stack, larger than 1, otherwise 0, and delete the two elements on the top of the stack, and finally push the result into the stack. | lt |
| 10 | gt   | /               | Whether the second element is smaller than the top of the stack, larger than 1, otherwise 0, and delete the two elements on the top of the stack, and finally push the result into the stack. | gt |
| 11 | le   | /               | Whether the second element is larger or equal than the top of the stack, larger than 1, otherwise 0, and delete the two elements on the top of the stack, and finally push the result into the stack. | le |

| 13 | lan  | /               | The second element and the first element are logically and operationally calculated, and the two elements at the top of the stack are deleted. Finally, the result push is put on the stack. | lan |
| 14 | lor  | /               | The second element and the first element are logically or operationally calculated, and the two elements at the top of the stack are deleted. Finally, the result push is put on the stack. | lor |

## Types
| Bytecode Name | ASM Name | describe |
|---|---|---|
| 00 | NUM | Number |
| 01 | STR | String |
| 02 | OBJ | Object |
| 03 | NUL | Null |
| 04 | UND | Undefined |

## Explanation of Address
bp register points to address 0x00000002 in initial state, sp points to address 0x00000002

## Notes
- When push null type, object type and undefined type are used, the value after push null is 0 of 1 byte.
- Push OBJ, 0 is to push an empty object into the stackã€‚
